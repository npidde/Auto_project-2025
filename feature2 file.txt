adding file in branch feature2 only 

remote repoisitory changes 

adding some random code-- treat this as your teammates work !!

public class OddNumberCheck {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 29; // Example number

        if (number % 2 != 0) { // If the remainder is not 0, it is odd
            System.out.println(number + " is an odd number.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(number + " is an even number.");
        }
    }
}
this is teammates work-- both working on same file..!!
public class GFG{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        
        int m = 9, n = 5;
        System.out.println("Before swapping: m = " + m + ", n = " + n);

        int temp = m;
        m = n;
        n = temp;

        System.out.println("After swapping: m = " + m + ", n = " + n);
    }
}
